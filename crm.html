                                  <p>Salespeople are constantly on the move—whether they're out in the field, meeting clients, or in between calls while driving. Because of this fast-paced and mobile nature of their job, accessing the CRM on a mobile device is essential. It allows them to quickly check customer details, update notes, and manage leads without needing to sit at a desk, making their workflow much more efficient and responsive.
